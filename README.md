### nginx installer

This is a nginx installer + configuration + modules + patches for web speed and security. 
Feel free to use, add, modify at will. Apart the normal build dependencies, it will install 
```lua 2.0``` (unless it's installed already), Google's ```brotli``` compression engine 
(better for large files), and a number of ```nginx``` modules. If you don't plan on using
all the modules, see the install files to disable them.  

This installer is for ```Ubuntu 14,15,16```


# Install
